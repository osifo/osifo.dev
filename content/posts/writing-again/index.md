> I realized that documenting my learnings is way more valuable than I had thought it to be. So, here's me committing to it in 2024.

### I decided to start writing again.

While at Andela, I got interested in writing - especially about my learnings from projects at work or from my personal breakable toys (maybe not so brekable).So I joinied the Writers' Club.

The year was 2017, sometime in the Q3 and I was actively working on a React Native project at work. Even though I had built one or two projects from the frontendMasters course I had taken, this was my first poduction-grade RN expereince and I was literally drinking from the firehose on this new engagement -  my first actually.

Onboarding started and I quickly buried myself in the codebase, learning the in and outs as much as I could. As is my thing, I had to build a test project to consolidate the ton of new knowledge I'd just  gained.

Thats when It hit me - What if I wrote a blog post about this project when I'm done. So, I did, and the writing club I'd just joined thought it was a great piece, so [they publised it!](https://medium.com/the-andela-way/how-to-structure-a-react-native-app-for-scale-a29194cd33fc)


Work schedule got crazy, so I kept procrastinating my next blog post. I tried to [catch my breath a few months later](https://medium.com/tilte/setting-up-tls-ssl-on-a-vps-with-letsencrypt-22cf20e649b0).


Then, crickets...


2021 saw me secure my domain (osifo.dev) with the hope that this would give me the needed drive to resume. I was wrong.

Sometime in 2023, while working on [my first foray into tech entrepreurship](https://onelink.to/dj6dgk), I shared some of my learnings on React native fonts, but that got lost when I changed server provider and forgot to migrate my data before the instance go deleted :(

It's EoY 2023 and I'm retrospecting on my year - actually the past few years, and I realized one thing I could have done better was to document my learnings. Speaking of learnings, there's been a lot of that, especially because in that 2020-2023 period, I'd moved from being a D4 Engineer (can't remember what the E-level was again), to leading the engineering org of a major Nigerian Fintech player for a little over a year, and then going back to being an IC (Iindividual Contributor), deploying features that scaled to over 50M global users, and then switching altogether from my forte of building for web/mobile to an entirely new terrain, IoT (internet of things) - all these while trying to grow my startup from project idea to commercial product on the side. Boy! that was quite a phase.

I wished that I had documented my learnings and experiences. At the minimum, I'll have them as a personal reference, and then there's the tiny probability that someone somewhere might find them worth learning a thing or two from.

So, this time, I decided to act. On one part because I have not experienced first-hand, the detriments of not documenting one's thoughts, and on the other hand, because I want to be more intentional about sharing knowledge.

I've been doing some learning about EdgexFoundry and so far it's looking like the perfect tool for building great breakable toys (who knows what else!). I'm looking forward to sharing my learnings on this as well.


Cheers to a better writing year ahead!
