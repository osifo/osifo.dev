## Risk Management Basics
There are two factors that are considered when discussing risk management:
- Risk per trade
- Risk-Reward ratio (R)

**Risk per Trade** refers to a certain $ value or a % amount that I can risk for each trade I enter.

**R** tells me how much i'm risking in comparison to my potential reward.
